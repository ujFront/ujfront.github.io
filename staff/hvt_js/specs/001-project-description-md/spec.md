## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When network connectivity is lost during input recording, how should the system behave? ‚Üí A: Queue updates locally and sync when connection restored (optimistic offline-first)
- Q: Can multiple sessions run simultaneously, or is there only one active session at a time? ‚Üí A: Single active session only - coaches must archive current before creating new
- Q: How should ties in total scores be handled in the ranked list? ‚Üí A: Shared position (e.g., two climbers tied at #2, next is #4)
- Q: Should climbers with zero recorded sends (no attempts at any grade) appear in results? ‚Üí A: Hide climbers with 0 points from results display
- Q: When multiple coaches update the same climber's data simultaneously, how should conflicts be resolved? ‚Üí A: Merge updates automatically if different fields affected
- Q: Can scoring configuration be changed mid-session, and if so, does it apply retroactively? ‚Üí A: Changes allowed and apply retroactively to recalculate all scores
- Q: Where are class lists stored and managed for loading into session rosters? ‚Üí A: in database
- Q: What happens when a climber attempts a grade outside the configured session range? ‚Üí A: Strictly enforce range - block/reject attempts outside configured grades
- Q: What is the data retention duration for archived sessions? ‚Üí A: keep until manually requested to delete

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Coach/Staff Member Using Input UI**:
During a climbing training session with 10‚Äì20 climbers, a coach needs to quickly record each climber's performance across different boulder grades (V0‚ÄìV17). The coach selects a climber, then rapidly taps buttons to log Flash sends, Top sends, or Attempts for each grade the climber tries. The system provides immediate visual feedback and automatically calculates scores based on configurable point values. The coach can switch between climbers by swiping or selecting from a list. Between sessions, the coach can create new sessions, clone previous session configurations (scoring rules and roster), reset current session data, or archive completed sessions.

**Public Viewer Using Results Dashboard**:
Climbers and spectators view a large screen (TV/tablet) displaying real-time or near-real-time session results. They see a mixed chart showing each climber's points by send type (Flash/Top/Attempt) as bars, with a line showing total scores, plus a ranked list of all climbers sorted by total points. The display updates automatically every 30‚Äì60 seconds without manual interaction, providing current standings throughout the session.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Session Management**:
1. **Given** no active session exists, **When** coach creates a new session with name "Monday Session", date, grade range V0‚ÄìV10, climbers ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], and scoring values, **Then** system creates session and displays input UI with 3 climber columns and 11 grade rows
2. **Given** a previous session exists with 5 climbers and specific scoring rules, **When** coach selects "Clone Previous", **Then** system creates new session with same scoring configuration and roster pre-filled
3. **Given** an active session with recorded data, **When** coach initiates reset and confirms by typing session name, **Then** system archives current data and creates fresh session with same configuration but zero counts

**Input Recording**:
4. **Given** coach has selected climber Alice, **When** coach taps "+5" button for V5 Flash, **Then** system increments Flash count by 5, shows immediate visual feedback, saves to database within debounce window, and updates Alice's total score
5. **Given** climber Bob has 3 Attempts at V7, **When** coach taps "‚Äì" button, **Then** system decrements count to 2, updates score, and persists change
6. **Given** coach rapidly taps "+3" multiple times within 300ms, **When** debounce triggers, **Then** system batches updates and saves once with accumulated total
7. **Given** coach is on a low-end tablet with 10 climbers visible, **When** coach scrolls and taps buttons rapidly, **Then** UI remains responsive with smooth feedback and no lag

**Results Display**:
8. **Given** active session with 5 climbers having various scores, **When** public viewer accesses results dashboard, **Then** system displays mixed chart with bars per send type per climber, line overlay for totals, and ranked list with positions
9. **Given** results dashboard is open, **When** coach updates climber data on input UI, **Then** dashboard reflects changes within 30‚Äì60 seconds automatically
10. **Given** dashboard is displayed on TV, **When** viewer toggles fullscreen mode, **Then** display expands to fill screen with appropriately sized typography (‚â•24px)

**Scoring**:
11. **Given** session configured with Flash=10pts, Top=5pts, Attempt=1pt for V5 grade, **When** Alice logs 2 Flashes, 1 Top, 3 Attempts at V5, **Then** system calculates Alice's V5 score as (2√ó10 + 1√ó5 + 3√ó1) = 28 points
12. **Given** mid-session with existing climber data and scoring change to Flash=15pts for V5, **When** coach modifies point values, **Then** system immediately recalculates all totals retroactively based on new values

**Multi-User Access**:
13. **Given** coach viewing input UI and public viewer viewing dashboard simultaneously, **When** coach updates climber data, **Then** both see updated totals within acceptable latency without conflicts

### Edge Cases

**Data & Validation**:
- What happens when a climber has no recorded sends (all zeros)? Climbers with 0 points are hidden from results display
- What happens when there's a tie in total scores? Tied climbers share same position with gap in sequence (e.g., two at #2, next is #4)
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during input? System queues updates locally and syncs when connection restored (optimistic offline-first approach)
- What happens when attempting to decrement a count that's already at 0?
- What happens when scoring configuration has missing values for certain grade/send-type combinations?

**Session Lifecycle**:
- Can archived sessions be restored or viewed? Archived sessions are retained indefinitely until manually deleted; they can be viewed but not restored to active status
- Can multiple sessions run simultaneously? Only one active session allowed at a time; coaches must archive current session before creating new one
- What happens when attempting to archive with unsaved changes? System prompts to save or discard changes before archiving

**Access & Concurrency**:
- What happens when multiple coaches try to update the same climber simultaneously? System merges updates automatically if different grade/send-type fields are affected; uses last-write-wins for same field conflicts
- What happens when results dashboard is accessed but no active session exists?

**Grade Range & Configuration**:
- What happens when a climber attempts a grade outside the configured session range? System strictly enforces configured range; only grades within session range are available for recording
- Can individual grades be hidden/dismissed from view within a session? Yes, individual grades can be hidden/dismissed from UI while maintaining session configuration
